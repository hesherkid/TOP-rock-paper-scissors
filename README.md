# TOP-rock-paper-scissors

This is the third project in The Odin Project and we will be creating the game rock, paper, scissors to be played completely in the web browser console. Once this project is completed I will be able to demonstrate skills with;

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Linux
- Github/Git
- README creation


We have since revisited this project and updated it to be played with a user interface using DOM Manipulation and adding onto the HTML.
